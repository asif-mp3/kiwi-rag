# Metric Definitions (Optional)
#
# Metrics are OPTIONAL. The system can work without any predefined metrics.
# Only "metric" query type requires metrics. Other query types (lookup, filter, 
# list, rank, extrema_lookup, aggregation_on_subset) work without metrics.
#
# Define metrics here if you want to use the "metric" query type for aggregations.
#
# Example format:
# metrics:
#   student_count:
#     description: "Total number of students"
#     sql: "COUNT(*)"
#     base_table: "sales"
#     allowed_dimensions:
#       - campus
#       - major
#       - degree

metrics: {}
